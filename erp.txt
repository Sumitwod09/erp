LUMIERE ERP - System Overview & Features
==========================================

CONCEPT
-------
Lumiere ERP is a state-of-the-art, modular Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system designed for desktop environments. Unlike traditional rigid ERPs, Lumiere is "Industry-Adaptive," allowing businesses to toggle specific modules on or off based on their unique operational needs.

This flexibility ensures that a retail store only sees retail tools, while a manufacturing unit has access to production planning and BOMs—all within the same core framework.

CORE ARCHITECTURE
-----------------
- Modular Design: Features are partitioned into self-contained modules that can be activated on-demand.
- Industry Presets: Pre-configured templates for Retail, Manufacturing, Services, and more.
- RBAC (Role-Based Access Control): Granular permission system ensuring secure data access.
- Cloud-First Backend: Powered by Nhost (GraphQL / PostgreSQL) for real-time synchronization and scalability.
- Cross-Platform UI: Built with Flutter for a premium, high-performance desktop experience.
